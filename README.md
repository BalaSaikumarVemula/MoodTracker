# 🌈 Mood Tracker (Java Console App)

Welcome to **Mood Tracker** — a fun, beginner-friendly Java console program that vibes with your emotions 😄  
You tell it how you feel, it replies with mood-based messages and motivational quotes.  
Originally written as a *vibe code* — no strict structure, just creativity — then refined into a clean mini project for learning Java basics.

---

## ✨ What It Does
- Takes your mood as input (happy, sad, angry, tired, etc.)
- Responds with matching messages
- Shows a random motivational quote
- Works entirely in one Java file
- Super light and beginner-friendly

---

## ⚙️ Run It Yourself
```bash
# Clone the project
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/mood-tracker.git
cd mood-tracker

# Compile and run
javac MoodTracker.java
java MoodTracker
````

**Example Output**

```
Hey there 👋 How are you feeling today?
> happy
😄 That’s awesome! Keep that energy up!

Here’s something for you:
"Every expert was once a beginner."

## 🧠 Why This Project Exists

I wrote this as a *vibe coding* experiment — meaning I didn’t overthink design, I just coded what felt right.
Later, I refined it to show how small, creative projects can also teach core Java concepts like:

* Input handling (`Scanner`)
* Conditional logic (`if-else`)
* Random number generation
* String handling
  It’s a great reminder that learning can be fun and spontaneous.

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

* Save previous moods in a log file
* Add a “quote of the day” system
* Build a GUI with JavaFX
* Expand it into a Spring Boot REST API
